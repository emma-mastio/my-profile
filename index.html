               <h3>Chapter 3 : 👟 Sneakers and business 💸</h3>
               <p>Ever since I went to school, I am digging the univers of <strong>sneakers</strong>. I think fashion is but far from our way of living. Whereas sneakers is a part of it. Thus I launch a little business of selling sneakers on Internet via Vinted for exemple. That's how I knew I wanted to do a business school🥰</p>
